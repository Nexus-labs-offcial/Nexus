# AGI Nexus project

Welcome to the AGI Nexus Project: Open-Source Revolution in General Artificial Intelligence.

## Overview

The AGI Nexus Project is a bold initiative to develop a powerful, ethical and universally accessible General Artificial Intelligence. Our aim is to rival the GPT-5 and GEMINI projects and ultimately to surpass, by far, the best proprietary AI, by creating a world-class open-source AGI.


# Development Roadmap

Explore our roadmap for the AGI Nexus Project, which defines the major milestones on our journey towards creating cutting-edge open-source General Artificial Intelligence.

# Phase 1: foundations of Nexus

In this first phase, we will lay the solid foundations for Nexus through a number of key stages that will run in parallel.

## Step 1.1: Creating the Nexus Forge

The Nexus Forge will be the cornerstone of our decentralised AI training cloud platform. This innovative platform will enable AI models to be trained in a decentralised way, using the computing power of thousands of computers spread across the world. It will serve as the starting point for our adventure towards a powerful and open-source AGI. In this case, many avenues can be used to use peer-to-peer networks already in use, to link them together or to create new ones.

## Ã‰tape 1.2 : Nexus Neural Network Development

Part 1.2 will focus on the creation and development of the Nexus modular neural network. [as explained methodologically in this document which explains the basic architecture of Nexus](architechture_Nexus.md)

## Step 1.3: Creating the Rich Dataset

Stage 1.3 of our progress process will be devoted methodically to the development of the data set, in accordance with the parameters set out in[the explanatory document detailing the methodology for designing the data corpus](dataset.md). In this vitally important phase, the methodological foundations dictating the creation of the dataset will be scrupulously followed in order to establish a high-quality dataset. The aim of this approach is to establish a reliable and relevant source of information to feed our company's ambitions, centred on improving our artificial intelligence model.

# Phase 2 : The creation of Nexus

## step 2.1: training the Nexus neural network

we train the neural network using data-parallelism on the remote computers that make up the De Nexus forge. 

## step 2.3: user interface

creation of an ergonomic and pleasant interface for a user a software which will allow us to interact with Nexus which will allow to create new instance to modify the preprompt and creates some.

## step 2.3: assessment protocol

creation of an AI evaluation service using and combining old tests from old evaluation datasets and new evaluation methods to get more in-depth testing and more relevant results on AI intelligence and to be able to filter the different capabilities and performance domains.

### phase 3: evaluation and launch of version 1

## step 3.1: evluation of Nexus 

launch the Nexus evolutionalutation to determine its strengths and weaknesses as well as its performance in relation to competing AI.

## step 3.2: quantization and inference acceleration algorithm.

set up 1 and 2 bit quantization algorithms for Nexus use algorithms to speed up model inference.

### phase 4: development and improvement

Meticulously optimising the model's performance in areas where there are shortcomings is an unavoidable undertaking, tending to generate transcendental levels of intelligence compared with the model's current configuration. At this stage of the evolution, it is anticipated that the level of performance will exceed that of the GPT-4 precursor by at least 1.7 times. It should be noted, however, that the improvement in reasoning, being of substantial complexity, reserves the possibility of an even more significant increase in results. Indeed, the exact nature of the improvements and their interaction with the underlying mechanisms remain factors whose magnitude of impact can only be stated after extensive testing and evaluation.

### phase 5: Future developments

Phase 5 represents the complete evolution in all domains to improve Nexus as well as future improvements not yet envisaged.
