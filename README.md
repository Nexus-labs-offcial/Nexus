# AGI Nexus project

Welcome to the AGI Nexus Project: Open-Source Revolution in General Artificial Intelligence.

## Overview

The AGI Nexus Project is a bold initiative to develop a powerful, ethical and universally accessible General Artificial Intelligence. Our goal is to rival the GPT-5 and GEMINI projects, and ultimately to far surpass proprietary AI vendors, by creating a world-class open-source AGI.

## Main objectives

- Redefining the limits of AI by offering an open-source AGI accessible to all.
- Provide a competitive alternative to proprietary models by encouraging open collaboration
- Establish solid ethical principles to guide the development of our AGI.
