# creation of the dataset

Creating the Nexus dataset will be a painstaking process. We will train the model from a basic understanding of the world and language. Then we will provide him with a multitude of push books in various fields to enrich his knowledge. Each data will be carefully considered and refined to build its own expert reasoning in the field concerned. The dataset will be designed to allow Nexus to propose natural and qualitative answers by combining its reasoning and the information available each reasoning will be refined and improved with thanks to a thought tree.

## expert reasoning:
We use the thought tree as a substrate to generate expert reasoning dedicated to the subject under consideration. This reasoning is elaborated in order to forge the most appropriate framework for each question. Thereafter, this reasoning undergoes a series of successive improvements, always in coherence with the tree of thought, until we judge that its relevance is optimal.


## critical price:
Each data integrated in the model will be subjected to a meticulous examination aiming at discerning the fallacious elements, for example, to discern the elements of fiction. The objective will be to probe the consistency and authenticity of this information, while establishing principles governing the completion of the truth. This approach converges towards the constitution of a data set of optimal quality.

## Repeated elements:
The dataset will be designed in such a way that the knowledge acquired during the training phase is consolidated as the dataset grows. This will allow the model to preserve and increase its cognitive acuity, while interpreting, from antecedent information, truths that are part of a quest for more acute understanding, especially in highly specialized fields.

## Analysis of User Preferences:
We elaborate an exhaustive reasoning with regard to the requirements of the user, in order to determine the authentic desires of this one. By answering a possible question formulated in an inadequate way, the tree of thought will be recalibrated to harmonize the answer with the need of the user. This approach will allow the AI to probe the needs of the user even before he perceives them. For example, it could study the user's work patterns and proactively offer procedural optimizations, or even perform certain tasks to improve their daily life. The AI will engage in in-depth reflection to better discern the aspirations and needs of the user, and present them to him before he becomes aware of them.

## Reasoning Elaboration of Answers:
This intellectual approach will be implemented with the aim of discerning the quintessence of the optimal mode of response to be provided to the user, whether he expects a response imbued with friendliness, precision, professionalism, or any other specific nuance.

## reasoning answer:
Following this step, the final reasoning will be engaged in order to shape the optimal response. This will carry out an exhaustive verification of all the preceding reasoning, with a view to generating a response that conforms in a superior way to these elements. Particular vigilance will be exercised in order to guarantee compliance with all the conclusions resulting from the various reasonings.
